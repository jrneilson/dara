:::{grid-item-card} ✨ Automated Refinement

Using [BGMN](http://www.bgmn.de) as a backend, Dara provides a simple and automated way
to refine phases in powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) data.

:::{grid-item-card} 🔍 Phase searching

Dara provides a parallelilzed tree search algorithm to search for phases in powder X-ray
diffraction data. It needs only two inputs:
(1) the raw X-ray diffraction pattern and (2) the reference phases. For the latter, Dara
also implements `CODDatabase` and `ICSDDatabase` to
help users query the reference CIFs in chemical system of interest in the COD and ICSD databases.
